# Neuron Release Notes

The Neuron SDK is delivered through commonly used package mananagers (e.g. PIP, APT and YUM). These packages are then themselves packaged into Conda packages that are integrated into the AWS DLAMI for minimal developer overhead.

The Neuron SDK release notes follow a similar structure, with the core improvements and known-issues reported in the release notes of the primary packages (e.g. Neuron-Runtime or Neuron-Compiler release notes), and additional release notes specific to the package-integration are reported through their dedicated release notes (e.g. Conda or DLAMI release notes).

This structure is shown below, with each also linking to the release notes for that package itself as well as showing the consitutuent included packages:
