# Neuron Release Notes

The Neuron SDK is delivered in several forms using popular package mananagers like PIP, APT and YUM. These packages are then themselves packaged into Conda packages that we integrate into the AWS DLAMI for easy and convenient usage.

These release notes follow this similar structure, with the main body of any known issues and new improvements being provided in the primary packageslike Neuron Runtime and Neuron Compiler. Additional issues specific to the packages themselves are provided - for example the DLAMI as a release itself or the Conda packages.

This structure is shown below, with each also linking to the release notes for that package itself as well as showing the consitutuent included packages.
