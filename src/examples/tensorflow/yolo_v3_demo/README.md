## Working with YOLO v3 using AWS Neuron SDK
AWS Neuron SDK is now supporting YOLO v3! Take a look at [`evaluate.ipynb`](https://github.com/aws/aws-neuron-sdk/blob/master/src/examples/tensorflow/yolo_v3_demo/evaluate.ipynb) which contains necessary steps for compiling and evaluating a tensorflow YOLO v3 model on AWS Inferentia.

Also please take a look at https://github.com/aws/aws-neuron-sdk/blob/master/src/examples/tensorflow/yolo_v4_demo/README.md for our YOLO v4 support as well as some performance optimization tips for deploying object detection models on Inferentia.
